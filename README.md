# C++ SoftUni Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to programming exercises from the C++ courses at SoftUni (Software University). The repository is organized by course modules and individual exercises, showcasing my learning journey in C++ programming.

## 📚 Course Structure

### First Steps in Coding
This module covers the fundamental concepts of programming with C++, including basic syntax, data types, input/output operations, and simple calculations.

#### Exercises Completed:

1. **01-HelloSoftUni** - First C++ program that prints "Hello SoftUni"
2. **02-NumbersOneToTen** - Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using cout
3. **03-RectangleArea** - Calculates and displays the area of a rectangle
4. **04-ConvertInchesToCM** - Converts inches to centimeters using a conversion factor
5. **05-GreetByName** - Takes user input for a name and greets them
6. **06-CombineTextAndNumbers** - Combines text and numerical data to create a personal introduction
7. **07-ProjectCreation** - Calculates total hours needed for project completion
8. **08-ZooShop** - Calculates total cost for dog and cat food purchases
9. **09-YardGreening** - Calculates final price with discount for yard greening services

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Language**: C++
- **IDE**: Visual Studio (based on .vcxproj files)
- **Standard**: C++11 or later
- **Build System**: MSBuild (Visual Studio)

```

Each exercise folder contains:
- `.cpp` source file
- Visual Studio project files (`.vcxproj`, `.vcxproj.filters`, `.vcxproj.user`)
- Debug build output in `x64/Debug/` folder

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (or any C++ compiler)
- Windows OS (based on the project structure)

### Running the Programs
1. Open the solution file `FirstStepsInCoding.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Select the project you want to run
3. Build and run the project (F5 or Ctrl+F5)

Alternatively, you can compile individual `.cpp` files using:
```bash
g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
./program_name
```

## 📝 Learning Progress

This repository demonstrates my progression through fundamental C++ concepts:

- **Basic I/O**: Using `cout` and `cin` for input/output operations
- **Data Types**: Working with `int`, `double`, and `string` types
- **Variables**: Declaring and initializing variables
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic mathematical calculations
- **String Manipulation**: Combining text and variables
- **Formatting Output**: Using `setf()` and `precision()` for formatted output
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down real-world problems into code solutions

## 🎯 Key Concepts Covered

- C++ syntax and structure
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Input/output operations
- Basic arithmetic operations
- String handling
- Output formatting
- Problem decomposition and algorithm design

## 📈 Future Plans

This repository will continue to grow as I progress through more advanced C++ topics including:
- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and arrays
- Object-oriented programming
- Data structures and algorithms
- Advanced C++ features
