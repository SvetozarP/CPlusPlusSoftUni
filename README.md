# C++ SoftUni Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to programming exercises from the C++ courses at SoftUni (Software University). The repository is organized by course modules and individual exercises, showcasing my learning journey in C++ programming.

## 📚 Course Structure

### First Steps in Coding
This module covers the fundamental concepts of programming with C++, including basic syntax, data types, input/output operations, and simple calculations.

#### Exercises Completed:

1. **01-HelloSoftUni** - First C++ program that prints "Hello SoftUni"
2. **02-NumbersOneToTen** - Prints numbers from 1 to 10 using cout
3. **03-RectangleArea** - Calculates and displays the area of a rectangle
4. **04-ConvertInchesToCM** - Converts inches to centimeters using a conversion factor
5. **05-GreetByName** - Takes user input for a name and greets them
6. **06-CombineTextAndNumbers** - Combines text and numerical data to create a personal introduction
7. **07-ProjectCreation** - Calculates total hours needed for project completion
8. **08-ZooShop** - Calculates total cost for dog and cat food purchases
9. **09-YardGreening** - Calculates final price with discount for yard greening services

#### Additional Practice Exercises:

10. **booksToRead** - Calculates daily reading hours needed to finish a book within a given timeframe
11. **consoleConverterUSDBGN** - Currency converter from USD to BGN with fixed decimal precision
12. **depositCalculator** - Calculates final deposit amount with monthly interest over a specified term
13. **radiansToDegreesConvert** - Converts radians to degrees using mathematical constants
14. **05suppliesForSchool** - Calculates total cost for school supplies (pens, markers, solution) with discount
15. **06repainting** - Calculates total cost for house repainting including materials and labor
16. **07foodDelivery** - Calculates total food delivery order cost including menu items, dessert, and delivery fee
17. **08basketballEquipment** - Calculates total cost for basketball equipment based on annual training cost
18. **09fishTank** - Calculates water volume needed for a fish tank accounting for decorations and space

```

Each exercise folder contains:
- `.cpp` source file
- Visual Studio project files (`.vcxproj`, `.vcxproj.filters`, `.vcxproj.user`)
- Debug build output in `x64/Debug/` folder

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2019 or later (or any C++ compiler)
- Windows OS (based on the project structure)

### Running the Programs
1. Open either solution file in Visual Studio:
   - `FirstStepsInCoding.sln` for the main exercises
   - `firstStepsInCodingEx.sln` for additional practice exercises
2. Select the project you want to run
3. Build and run the project (F5 or Ctrl+F5)

Alternatively, you can compile individual `.cpp` files using:
```bash
g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
./program_name
```

## 📝 Learning Progress

This repository demonstrates my progression through fundamental C++ concepts:

- **Basic I/O**: Using `cout` and `cin` for input/output operations
- **Data Types**: Working with `int`, `double`, and `string` types
- **Variables**: Declaring and initializing variables
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic mathematical calculations
- **String Manipulation**: Combining text and variables
- **Formatting Output**: Using `setf()`, `precision()`, and `setprecision()` for formatted output
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down real-world problems into code solutions
- **Mathematical Functions**: Using `floor()` and `round()` for number manipulation
- **Mathematical Constants**: Working with PI and conversion factors
- **Financial Calculations**: Interest calculations, currency conversion, and cost analysis
- **Volume Calculations**: 3D geometry and unit conversions
- **Complex Logic**: Multi-step calculations with percentages and discounts
